# Tic-Tac-Chaos

Tic-Tac-Chaos is an exciting twist on Ultimate Tic-tac-toe, featuring special pieces and unique gameplay mechanics. This multiplayer web game combines strategic thinking with special abilities to create a dynamic and engaging experience.

## Game Rules

### Basic Rules
- The game is played on 9 small tic-tac-toe boards arranged in a 3x3 grid.
- Your move in a small board determines which big board your opponent must play in next.
- Win three small boards in a row to win the game.
- If sent to a completed board, you can play in any available board.

### Special Pieces
Each player gets one of each special piece per game:

1. ðŸŒ€ **Phantom**
   - Can swap positions with an opponent's piece to the left or right.
   - Use strategically to disrupt opponent's patterns.

2. ðŸ’¥ **Crusher**
   - Pushes adjacent pieces one space away (but not diagonally).
   - Great for creating space or breaking opponent's lines.

3. ðŸ“¦ **Stacker**
   - Can be placed on top of opponent's existing pieces.
   - Cannot be placed on your own pieces.
   - Perfect for capturing key positions.
